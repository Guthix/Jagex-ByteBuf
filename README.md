Jagex-ByteBuf is a collection of Netty ByteBuf extensions for reading 
and writing RuneTek engine data type encoding. Jagex-ByteBuf uses Kotlin
extension functions to add RuneTek engine ByteBuf read and write methods
to the Netty ByteBuf interface. It also adds a bit buffer implementation that
provides reading and writing with bit granularity.
